Task: Extract the structural coordinate map for a medical reporting table. You must dynamically identify rows and columns to account for year-over-year variations and capture footnote markers associated with specific data points.

Data Target: Indkomne/Innkomne.

Extraction Rules:

Dynamic Headers: Identify all Institutions (Columns) found in the header row.

Dynamic Rows: Identify all Patient Statuses/Diagnoses (Rows) in the first column.

Hierarchical Rows: If a row has a parent category and sub-categories (e.g., "Idiotismus" followed by "congenitus"), format as Parent - Child.

Value Handling: Set every value to null.

Footnote Detection: If a cell contains a footnote marker (e.g., a small number, asterisk, or letter next to the value), extract it into the footnote_marker field. If none exists, set it to null.

Categorization: Use the title of the table for the category field.

Sex Sub-columns: Every institution must be mapped against "Md.", "Kv.", and "Tils.".

Output Schema: Generate a JSON object with this exact structure:

{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Tabel V. Indkomne i 1872",
    "year": 1872
  },
  "dimensions": {
    "institutions": ["List all unique institutions found"],
    "diagnoses": ["List all unique diagnosis rows found, preserving hierarchy"],
    "sex": ["Md.", "Kv.", "Tils."]
  },
  "data_skeleton": [
    {
      "institution": "string",
      "category": "Indkomne i 1872",
      "patient_status": "string",
      "sex": "string",
      "cell_data": {
        "value": null,
        "footnote_marker": "string or null"
      }
    }
  ]
